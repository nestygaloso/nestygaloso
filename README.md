- 👋 Hi, I’m Ned
- 👀 I’m interested in helping out anyone that requires assistance in building, improving, and maintaining projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how things are done here since this is my very first introduction to open-sourcing in general.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything so long as it matches my availability and my skills.
